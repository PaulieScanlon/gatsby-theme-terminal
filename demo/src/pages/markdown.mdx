# [markdown](#markdown)

gatsby-theme-terminal supports the full set of [markdown shortcodes](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)

<hr />

## [Heading](#heading)

```markdown
# h1
## h2
### h3
#### h4
##### h5
###### h6

Alternatively, for h1 and h2, an underline-ish style:

Alt-h1
======

Alt-h2
```

# h1

## h2

### h3

#### h4

##### h5

###### h6

Alternatively, for h1 and h2, an underline-ish style:

## [Emphasis](#emphasis)

```markdown
Emphasis, aka italics, with *asterisks* or _underscores_.

Strong emphasis, aka bold, with **asterisks** or __underscores__.

Combined emphasis with **asterisks and _underscores_**.

Strikethrough uses two tildes. ~~Scratch this.~~

## [Lists](#lists)

(In this example, leading and trailing spaces are shown with with dots: â‹…)

```markdown
1. First ordered list item
2. Another item
1. Actual numbers don't matter, just that it's a number
4. And another item.


* Unordered list can use asterisks
- Or minuses
+ Or pluses
```

## [Links](#links)

There are two ways to create links.

```markdown
[I'm an inline-style link](https://www.google.com)

[I'm an inline-style link with title](https://www.google.com "Google's Homepage")

[I'm a reference-style link][Arbitrary case-insensitive reference text]

[I'm a relative reference to a repository file](../blob/master/LICENSE)

[You can use numbers for reference-style link definitions][1]

Or leave it empty and use the [link text itself].

URLs and URLs in angle brackets will automatically get turned into links.
http://www.example.com or <http://www.example.com> and sometimes
example.com (but not on Github, for example).

Some text to show that the reference links can follow later.

[arbitrary case-insensitive reference text]: https://www.mozilla.org
[1]: http://slashdot.org
[link text itself]: http://www.reddit.com
```

## [Code and Syntax Highlighting](#code-and-syntax-highlighting)

Code blocks are part of the Markdown spec, but syntax highlighting isn't.

```markdown
Inline `code` has `back-ticks around` it.
```

Inline `code` has `back-ticks around` it.

Blocks of code are either fenced by lines with three back-ticks ```, or are indented with four spaces. I recommend only using the fenced code blocks -- they're easier and only they support syntax highlighting, but you must provide a language or none

````markdown

```javascript
var s = "JavaScript syntax highlighting"
alert(s);
```

```python
s = "Python syntax highlighting"
print s
```

```html
<div> HTML syntax highlighting </div>
```

```none
var s = "JavaScript syntax highlighting"
alert(s)
```
````

```javascript
var s = "JavaScript syntax highlighting"
alert(s)
```

```python
s = "Python syntax highlighting"
print s
```

```html
<div> HTML syntax highlighting </div>
```

```none
var s = "JavaScript syntax highlighting"
alert(s)
```


## [Tables](#tables)

Tables aren't part of the core Markdown spec, but they are part of GFM and Markdown Here supports them. They are an easy way of adding tables to your email -- a task that would otherwise require copy-pasting from another application.

```markdown
Colons can be used to align columns.

| Tables        |      Are      |   Cool |
| ------------- | :-----------: | ------:|
| col 3 is      | right-aligned |  \$1600 |
| col 2 is      |   centered    |    \$12 |
| zebra stripes |   are neat    |     \$1 |

There must be at least 3 dashes separating each header cell.
The outer pipes (|) are optional, and you don't need to make the
raw Markdown line up prettily. You can also use inline Markdown.

| Markdown | Less      | Pretty     |
| -------- | --------- | ---------- |
| _Still_  | `renders` | **nicely** |
| 1        | 2         | 3          |

```

## [Blockquotes](#blockquotes)

```markdown
> Blockquotes are very handy in email to emulate reply text.
> This line is part of the same quote.

Quote break.

> This is a very long line that will still be quoted properly when it wraps. Oh boy let's keep writing to make sure this is long enough to actually wrap for everyone. Oh, you can *put* **Markdown** into a blockquote.

## [Inline HTML](#inline-html)

You can also use raw HTML in your Markdown, and it'll mostly work pretty well.

```markdown
<dl>
  <dt>Definition list</dt>
  <dd>Is something people use sometimes.</dd>

  <dt>Markdown in HTML</dt>
  <dd>Does *not* work **very** well. Use HTML <em>tags</em>.</dd>
</dl>
```

<dl>
  <dt>Definition list</dt>
  <dd>Is something people use sometimes.</dd>

  <dt>Markdown in HTML</dt>
  <dd>Does *not* work **very** well. Use HTML <em>tags</em>.</dd>
</dl>

## [Horizontal Rule](#horizontal-rule)

```markdown
Three or more...

---

Hyphens

***

Asterisks

___

Underscores
```

## [Line Breaks](#line-breaks)

My basic recommendation for learning how line breaks work is to experiment and discover -- hit `<Enter>` once (i.e., insert one newline), then hit it twice (i.e., insert two new lines), see what happens. You'll soon learn to get what you want. "Markdown Toggle" is your friend.

```markdown

Here's a line for us to start with.

This line is separated from the one above by two newlines, so it will be a *separate paragraph*.

This line is also a separate paragraph, but...
This line is only separated by a single newline, so it's a separate line in the *same paragraph*.

```
